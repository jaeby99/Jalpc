			    	I am an assistant professor in
				<strong> School of Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University </strong>
				since September 2022. Before joining Chung-Ang University, I obtained my Ph.D. in <strong>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University</strong> 
				advised by 
				<strong> Jong-Seon No </strong>
				in August 2022.
				<br><br>My research interests are 
				<strong>privacy-preserving machine learning (PPML) </strong>
				with cryptographic tools. During my graduate course at SNU, I have been working mainly on primitives in <strong>fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)</strong>
				, advanced algorithms on FHE, and efficient PPML with deep neural networks. I am also interested in 
				<strong> hardware optimization </strong>
				for PPML on FHE and practical implementation of PPML for 
				<strong> AI-as-a-service (AIaaS) </strong>
				cloud systems.
				<br><br>Other research interests are 
				<strong> post-quantum cryptography (PQC)</strong>
				, <strong> multi-party computation (MPC)</strong>
				, and <strong> advanced lattice-based encryption schemes</strong>.
